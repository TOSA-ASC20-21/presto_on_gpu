You need a CUDA library to compile the code. And make sure informations for CUDA are correct in the Makefile 
under $PRESTO/src. Modify them if necessary.

Only accelsearch is GPUed. To run accelsearch on GPU, use the -cuda option. Or the program will run on CPU.
For example: accelsearch -numharm 16 -zmax 256 ur_data.dat -cuda 0
0 means the 1st GPU in your machine.
